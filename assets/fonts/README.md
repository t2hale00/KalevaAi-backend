# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the newspaper brand fonts.

## Font Specifications

### Axiforma Font
- **Font Family**: Axiforma
- **Color**: White
- **Size**: 
  - 80 px for stories
  - 60 px for posts

## Required Fonts

For each newspaper, you may need:
- Axiforma (primary brand font)
- Custom newspaper fonts

## Getting Fonts

1. Contact Kaleva Media for official brand fonts
2. Or use system fonts as fallback (currently implemented)

## Current Implementation

The system currently uses:
- Arial as fallback font
- System default fonts when custom fonts are not available

This works for testing but for production, proper brand fonts should be added.

## Campaign Title Positioning

- **Stories**: Top Right
