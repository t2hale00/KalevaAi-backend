# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the newspaper brand fonts.

## Required Fonts

For each newspaper, you may need:
- Axiforma (mentioned in brand specs)
- Custom newspaper fonts

## Getting Fonts

1. Contact Kaleva Media for official brand fonts
2. Or use system fonts as fallback (currently implemented)

## Current Implementation

The system currently uses:
- Arial as fallback font
- System default fonts when custom fonts are not available

This works for testing but for production, proper brand fonts should be added.
